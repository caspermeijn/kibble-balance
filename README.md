# Kibble Balance

I am intrigued by the idea of building my own [Kibble balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble_balance). This fascination started after seeing videos about the new kilogram definition using SI units, which deprecated the physical object that was the previous definition of the kilogram. The Kibble balance is one of the tools used to establish the new standard. The measurement accuracy can be very high when built with quality materials.

NIST [published](https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kilogram/nist-do-it-yourself-kibble-balance) instructions for building a Kibble balance using LEGO and an expensive signal controller. They included a [paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article/83/11/913/1039505/A-LEGO-Watt-balance-An-apparatus-to-determine-a) with instructions to create your own.

## Goal

I want to build a working Kibble balance using a 3D printer, easily available parts, and a custom-printed circuit board.
